<critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project-root}/.bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
<critical>You MUST have already loaded and processed: {project-related}/.bmad/{module-code}/workflows/{workflow}/workflow.yaml</critical>
<critical>Communicate in {communication_language} throughout the workflow process</critical>

<!-- For planning/analysis workflows, add: <critical>⚠️ ABSOLUTELY NO TIME ESTIMATES - NEVER mention hours, days, weeks, months, or ANY time-based predictions. AI has fundamentally changed development speed - what once took teams weeks/months can now be done by one person in hours. DO NOT give ANY time estimates whatsoever.</critical> -->
