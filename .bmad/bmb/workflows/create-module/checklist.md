- [ ] Permissions requirements documented

## Documentation

### README.md

- [ ] Installation instructions included
- [ ] Component listing with descriptions
- [ ] Quick start guide provided
- [ ] Configuration options documented
- [ ] At least one usage example
- [ ] Directory structure shown
- [ ] Author and date information

### Component Documentation

- [ ] Tasks are documented (if present)
- [ ] Examples demonstrate typical usage

### Development Roadmap

- [ ] TODO.md or roadmap section exists
- [ ] Planned components listed
- [ ] Development phases identified
- [ ] Quick commands for adding components

## Integration

### Cross-component References

- [ ] All internal paths use module variables
- [ ] External dependencies declared

### Module Boundaries

- [ ] Module scope is well-defined
- [ ] No feature creep into other domains
- [ ] Clear separation from other modules

## Quality Checks

### Completeness

- [ ] At least one functional component (not all placeholders)
- [ ] Core functionality is implementable
- [ ] Module provides clear value

### Consistency

- [ ] Formatting consistent across files
- [ ] Variable naming follows conventions
- [ ] Communication style appropriate for domain

### Scalability

- [ ] Structure supports future growth
- [ ] Component organization is logical
- [ ] No hard-coded limits

## Testing and Validation

### Structural Validation

- [ ] YAML files parse without errors
- [ ] JSON files (if any) are valid
- [ ] XML files (if any) are well-formed
- [ ] No syntax errors in JavaScript files

### Path Validation

- [ ] All referenced paths exist or are clearly marked as TODO
- [ ] Variable substitutions are correct
- [ ] No absolute paths (unless intentional)

### Installation Testing

- [ ] Installation steps can be simulated
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Uninstall process defined (if complex)

## Final Checks

### Ready for Use

## Issues Found

### Critical Issues

<!-- List any issues that MUST be fixed before module can be used -->

### Warnings

<!-- List any issues that should be addressed but won't prevent basic usage -->

### Improvements

<!-- List any optional enhancements that would improve the module -->

### Missing Components

## Module Complexity Assessment

### Complexity Rating
