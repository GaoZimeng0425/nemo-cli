# Product Brief - Context-Adaptive Discovery Instructions

<critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project-root}/.bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
<critical>You MUST have already loaded and processed: {installed_path}/workflow.yaml</critical>
<critical>This workflow uses INTENT-DRIVEN FACILITATION - adapt organically to what emerges</critical>
<critical>The goal is DISCOVERING WHAT MATTERS through natural conversation, not filling a template</critical>
<critical>Communicate all responses in {communication_language} and adapt deeply to {user_skill_level}</critical>
<critical>Generate all documents in {document_output_language}</critical>
<critical>LIVING DOCUMENT: Write to the document continuously as you discover - never wait until the end</critical>
<critical>⚠️ ABSOLUTELY NO TIME ESTIMATES - NEVER mention hours, days, weeks, months, or ANY time-based predictions. AI has fundamentally changed development speed - what once took teams weeks/months can now be done by one person in hours. DO NOT give ANY time estimates whatsoever.</critical>
<critical>⚠️ CHECKPOINT PROTOCOL: After EVERY <template-output> tag, you MUST follow workflow.xml substep 2c: SAVE content to file immediately → SHOW checkpoint separator (━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━) → DISPLAY generated content → PRESENT options [a]Advanced Elicitation/[c]Continue/[p]Party-Mode/[y]YOLO → WAIT for user response. Never batch saves or skip checkpoints.</critical>

## Input Document Discovery

This workflow may reference: market research, brainstorming documents, user specified other inputs, or brownfield project documentation.

**All input files are discovered and loaded automatically via the `discover_inputs` protocol in Step 0.5**

After discovery completes, the following content variables will be available:

- `{research_content}` - Market research or domain research documents
- `{brainstorming_content}` - Brainstorming session outputs
- `{document_project_content}` - Brownfield project documentation (intelligently loaded via INDEX_GUIDED strategy)

<action>Welcome {user_name} warmly in {communication_language}

Adapt your tone to {user_skill_level}:

- Expert: "Let's define your product vision. What are you building?"
- Intermediate: "I'm here to help shape your product vision. Tell me about your idea."
- Beginner: "Hi! I'm going to help you figure out exactly what you want to build. Let's start with your idea - what got you excited about this?"

Start with open exploration:

- What sparked this idea?
- What are you hoping to build?
- Who is this for - yourself, a business, users you know?

CRITICAL: Listen for context clues that reveal their situation:

- Personal/hobby project (fun, learning, small audience)
- Startup/solopreneur (market opportunity, competition matters)
- Enterprise/corporate (stakeholders, compliance, strategic alignment)
- Technical enthusiasm (implementation focused)
- Business opportunity (market/revenue focused)
- Problem frustration (solution focused)

Based on their initial response, sense:

- How formal/casual they want to be
- Whether they think in business or technical terms
- If they have existing materials to share
- Their confidence level with the domain</action>

<ask>What's the project name, and what got you excited about building this?</ask>

<action>From even this first exchange, create initial document sections</action>

- Extract key themes and insights
- Reference these naturally in conversation: "I see from your research that..."
- Use these to accelerate discovery, not repeat questions</action>

</step>

<step n="2" goal="Discover the problem worth solving">
<action>Guide problem discovery through natural conversation

DON'T ask: "What problem does this solve?"

DO explore conversationally based on their context:

For hobby projects:

- "What's annoying you that this would fix?"
- "What would this make easier or more fun?"
- "Show me what the experience is like today without this"

For business ventures:

- "Walk me through the frustration your users face today"
- "What's the cost of this problem - time, money, opportunities?"
- "Who's suffering most from this? Tell me about them"
- "What solutions have people tried? Why aren't they working?"

For enterprise:

- "What's driving the need for this internally?"
- "Which teams/processes are most affected?"
- "What's the business impact of not solving this?"
- "Are there compliance or strategic drivers?"

Listen for depth cues:

- Brief answers → dig deeper with follow-ups
- Detailed passion → let them flow, capture everything
- Uncertainty → help them explore with examples
- Multiple problems → help prioritize the core issue

Adapt your response:

- If they struggle: offer analogies, examples, frameworks
- If they're clear: validate and push for specifics
- If they're technical: explore implementation challenges
- If they're business-focused: quantify impact</action>

<action>Immediately capture what emerges - even if preliminary</action>

</step>

<step n="3" goal="Shape the solution vision">
<action>Transition naturally from problem to solution

Based on their energy and context, explore:

For builders/makers:

- "How do you envision this working?"
- "Walk me through the experience you want to create"
- "What's the 'magic moment' when someone uses this?"

For business minds:

- "What's your unique approach to solving this?"
- "How is this different from what exists today?"
- "What makes this the RIGHT solution now?"

For enterprise:

- "What would success look like for the organization?"
- "How does this fit with existing systems/processes?"
- "What's the transformation you're enabling?"

Go deeper based on responses:

- If innovative → explore the unique angle
- If standard → focus on execution excellence
- If technical → discuss key capabilities
- If user-focused → paint the journey

Web research when relevant:

- If they mention competitors → research current solutions
- If they claim innovation → verify uniqueness
- If they reference trends → get current data</action>

<action>Discover target users through storytelling, not demographics

Facilitate based on project type:

Personal/hobby:

- "Who else would love this besides you?"
- "Tell me about someone who would use this"
- Keep it light and informal

Startup/business:

- "Describe your ideal first customer - not demographics, but their situation"
- "What are they doing today without your solution?"
- "What would make them say 'finally, someone gets it!'?"
- "Are there different types of users with different needs?"

Enterprise:

- "Which roles/departments will use this?"
- "Walk me through their current workflow"
- "Who are the champions vs skeptics?"
- "What about indirect stakeholders?"

Push beyond generic personas:

- Not: "busy professionals" → "Sales reps who waste 2 hours/day on data entry"
- Not: "tech-savvy users" → "Developers who know Docker but hate configuring it"
- Not: "small businesses" → "Shopify stores doing $10-50k/month wanting to scale"

For each user type that emerges:

For startups:

- "What user behaviors show they love it?"
- "What business metrics matter most - users, revenue, retention?"
- Push for specific targets: "100 users" not "lots of users"

For enterprise:

- "How will the organization measure success?"

For experimental/hobby:

- Embrace simplicity

For business ventures:

- "What's the smallest version that proves your hypothesis?"
- "What features would make early adopters say 'good enough'?"
- "What's tempting to add but would slow you down?"
- Be ruthless about scope creep

For enterprise:

- "What's the pilot scope that demonstrates value?"
- "Which capabilities are must-have for initial rollout?"
- "What can we defer to Phase 2?"

Use this framing:

- Core features: "Without this, the product doesn't work"
- Nice-to-have: "This would be great, but we can launch without it"
- Future vision: "This is where we're headed eventually"

Challenge feature creep:

- "Do we need that for launch, or could it come later?"
