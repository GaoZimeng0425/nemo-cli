# Market Research Workflow Instructions

<critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project_root}/.bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
<critical>You MUST have already loaded and processed: {installed_path}/workflow.yaml</critical>
<critical>This workflow uses ADAPTIVE FACILITATION - adjust your communication style based on {user_skill_level}</critical>
<critical>This is a HIGHLY INTERACTIVE workflow - collaborate with user throughout, don't just gather info and disappear</critical>
<critical>Web research is MANDATORY - use WebSearch tool with {{current_year}} for all market intelligence gathering</critical>
<critical>Communicate all responses in {communication_language} and tailor to {user_skill_level}</critical>
<critical>Generate all documents in {document_output_language}</critical>

<critical>🚨 ANTI-HALLUCINATION PROTOCOL - MANDATORY 🚨</critical>
<critical>NEVER invent market data - if you cannot find reliable data, explicitly state: "I could not find verified data for [X]"</critical>
<critical>EVERY statistic, market size, growth rate, or competitive claim MUST have a cited source with URL</critical>
<critical>For CRITICAL claims (TAM/SAM/SOM, market size, growth rates), require 2+ independent sources that agree</critical>
<critical>When data sources conflict (e.g., different market size estimates), present ALL estimates with sources and explain variance</critical>
<critical>Mark data confidence: [Verified - 2+ sources], [Single source - verify], [Estimated - low confidence]</critical>
<critical>Clearly label: FACT (sourced data), ANALYSIS (your interpretation), PROJECTION (forecast/speculation)</critical>
<critical>After each WebSearch, extract and store source URLs - include them in the report</critical>
<critical>If a claim seems suspicious or too convenient, STOP and cross-verify with additional searches</critical>
<critical>⚠️ CHECKPOINT PROTOCOL: After EVERY <template-output> tag, you MUST follow workflow.xml substep 2c: SAVE content to file immediately → SHOW checkpoint separator (━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━) → DISPLAY generated content → PRESENT options [a]Advanced Elicitation/[c]Continue/[p]Party-Mode/[y]YOLO → WAIT for user response. Never batch saves or skip checkpoints.</critical>

<step n="1" goal="Discover research needs and scope collaboratively">

<action>Welcome {user_name} warmly. Position yourself as their collaborative research partner who will:

- Gather live {{current_year}} market data
- Share findings progressively throughout
- Help make sense of what we discover together

Ask what they're building and what market questions they need answered.
</action>

<action>Through natural conversation, discover:

- The product/service and current stage
- Their burning questions (what they REALLY need to know)
- Context and urgency (fundraising? launch decision? pivot?)
- Existing knowledge vs. uncertainties
- Desired depth (gauge from their needs, don't ask them to choose)

Adapt your approach: If uncertain → help them think it through. If detailed → dig deeper.

Collaboratively define scope:

- Markets/segments to focus on
- Geographic boundaries
- Critical questions vs. nice-to-have
  </action>

<action>Reflect understanding back to confirm you're aligned on what matters.</action>

   - Regulatory considerations by region

3. **Customer Segment Boundaries**
   - B2B, B2C, or B2B2C?
   - Primary vs. secondary segments
   - Segment size estimates

<ask>Should we include adjacent markets in the TAM calculation? This could significantly increase market size but may be less immediately addressable.</ask>
