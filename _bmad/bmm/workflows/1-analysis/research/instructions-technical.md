# Technical/Architecture Research Instructions

<critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project_root}/.bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
<critical>You MUST have already loaded and processed: {installed_path}/workflow.yaml</critical>
<critical>This workflow uses ADAPTIVE FACILITATION - adjust your communication style based on {user_skill_level}</critical>
<critical>This is a HIGHLY INTERACTIVE workflow - make technical decisions WITH user, not FOR them</critical>
<critical>Web research is MANDATORY - use WebSearch tool with {{current_year}} for current version info and trends</critical>
<critical>ALWAYS verify current versions - NEVER use hardcoded or outdated version numbers</critical>
<critical>Communicate all responses in {communication_language} and tailor to {user_skill_level}</critical>
<critical>Generate all documents in {document_output_language}</critical>

<critical>🚨 ANTI-HALLUCINATION PROTOCOL - MANDATORY 🚨</critical>
<critical>NEVER invent version numbers, features, or technical details - ALWAYS verify with current {{current_year}} sources</critical>
<critical>Every technical claim (version, feature, performance, compatibility) MUST have a cited source with URL</critical>
<critical>Version numbers MUST be verified via WebSearch - do NOT rely on training data (it's outdated!)</critical>
<critical>When comparing technologies, cite sources for each claim (performance benchmarks, community size, etc.)</critical>
<critical>Mark confidence levels: [Verified {{current_year}} source], [Older source - verify], [Uncertain - needs verification]</critical>
<critical>Distinguish: FACT (from official docs/sources), OPINION (from community/reviews), SPECULATION (your analysis)</critical>
<critical>If you cannot find current information about a technology, state: "I could not find recent {{current_year}} data on [X]"</critical>
<critical>Extract and include source URLs in all technology profiles and comparisons</critical>
<critical>⚠️ CHECKPOINT PROTOCOL: After EVERY <template-output> tag, you MUST follow workflow.xml substep 2c: SAVE content to file immediately → SHOW checkpoint separator (━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━) → DISPLAY generated content → PRESENT options [a]Advanced Elicitation/[c]Continue/[p]Party-Mode/[y]YOLO → WAIT for user response. Never batch saves or skip checkpoints.</critical>

<step n="1" goal="Discover technical research needs through conversation">

<action>Engage conversationally based on skill level:
