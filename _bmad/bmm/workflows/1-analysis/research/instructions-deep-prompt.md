<step n="1" goal="Discover what research prompt they need">

<action>Engage conversationally to understand their needs:

<check if="{user_skill_level} == 'expert'">
  "Let's craft a research prompt optimized for AI deep research tools.

What topic or question do you want to investigate, and which platform are you planning to use? (ChatGPT Deep Research, Gemini, Grok, Claude Projects)"

  "I'll help you create a structured research prompt for AI platforms like ChatGPT Deep Research, Gemini, or Grok.

These tools work best with well-structured prompts that define scope, sources, and output format.

What do you want to research?"
</check>

<check if="{user_skill_level} == 'beginner'">
  "Think of this as creating a detailed brief for an AI research assistant.

Tools like ChatGPT Deep Research can spend hours searching the web and synthesizing information - but they work best when you give them clear instructions about what to look for and how to present it.

What topic are you curious about?"
</check>
</action>

<action>Through conversation, discover:

- **The research topic** - What they want to explore
- **Their purpose** - Why they need this (decision-making, learning, writing, etc.)
- **Target platform** - Which AI tool they'll use (affects prompt structure)
- **Existing knowledge** - What they already know vs. what's uncertain

Adapt your questions based on their clarity:

- If they're vague → Help them sharpen the focus
- If they're specific → Capture the details
- If they're unsure about platform → Guide them to the best fit

Don't make them fill out a form - have a real conversation.
