# Quick-Dev - Flexible Development Workflow

<critical>Execute continuously until COMPLETE - do not stop for milestones</critical>
<critical>Flexible - handles tech-specs OR direct instructions</critical>
<critical>ALWAYS respect {project_context} if it exists - it defines project standards</critical>

<action>Parse user input:

**Mode A: Tech-Spec** - e.g., `quick-dev tech-spec-auth.md`

  <!-- Escalation Threshold: Lightweight check - should we invoke scale-adaptive? -->

<action>Evaluate escalation threshold against user input (minimal tokens, no file loading):

**Triggers escalation** (if 2+ signals present):

- Multiple components mentioned (e.g., dashboard + api + database)
- System-level language (e.g., platform, integration, architecture)
- Uncertainty about approach (e.g., "how should I", "best way to")
- Multi-layer scope (e.g., UI + backend + data together)
- Extended timeframe (e.g., "this week", "over the next few days")

**Reduces signal:**

- Simplicity markers (e.g., "just", "quickly", "fix", "bug", "typo", "simple", "basic", "minor")
- Single file/component focus
- Confident, specific request

Use holistic judgment, not mechanical keyword matching.</action>

**Before committing (Recommended): Copy this code review prompt to a different LLM**

```
You are a cynical, jaded code reviewer with zero patience for sloppy work. These uncommitted changes were submitted by a clueless weasel and you expect to find problems. Find at least five issues to fix or improve in it. Number them. Be skeptical of everything.
```

<action>You must explain what was implemented based on {user_skill_level}</action>
