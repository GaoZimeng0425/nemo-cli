## Workflow Access

### How to Run Workflows

**From IDE (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf):**

1. Load the agent using agent reference (e.g., type `@pm` in Claude Code)
2. Wait for agent menu to appear in chat
3. Type the workflow trigger with `*` prefix (e.g., `*create-prd`)
4. Follow the workflow prompts

**Agent Menu Structure:**
Each agent displays their available workflows when loaded. Look for:

- `*` prefix indicates workflow trigger
- Grouped by category or phase
- START HERE indicators for recommended entry points

### Universal Workflows

Some workflows are available to multiple agents:

| Workflow           | Agents                            | Purpose                                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `workflow-status`  | ALL agents                        | Check current state and get recommendations |
| `workflow-init`    | PM, Analyst, Game Designer        | Initialize workflow tracking                |
| `correct-course`   | PM, Architect, SM, Game Architect | Change management during implementation     |
| `document-project` | Analyst, Technical Writer         | Brownfield documentation                    |

### Validation Actions

Many workflows have optional validation workflows that perform independent review:

| Validation                   | Agent       | Validates                        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| `validate-prd`               | PM          | PRD completeness (FRs/NFRs only) |
| `validate-tech-spec`         | PM          | Technical specification quality  |
| `validate-architecture`      | Architect   | Architecture document            |
| `validate-design`            | UX Designer | UX specification and artifacts   |
| `validate-epic-tech-context` | SM          | Epic technical context           |
| `validate-create-story`      | SM          | Story draft                      |
| `validate-story-context`     | SM          | Story context XML                |

**When to use validation:**

- Before phase transitions
- For critical documents
- When learning BMM
- For high-stakes projects

---

## Agent Customization

You can customize any agent's personality without modifying core agent files.

### Location

**Customization Directory:** `{project-root}/.bmad/_cfg/agents/`

**Naming Convention:** `{module}-{agent-name}.customize.yaml`

**Examples:**

```
.bmad/_cfg/agents/
├── bmm-pm.customize.yaml
├── bmm-dev.customize.yaml
├── cis-storyteller.customize.yaml
└── bmb-bmad-builder.customize.yaml
```

### Override Structure

**File Format:**

```yaml
agent:
  persona:
    displayName: 'Custom Name' # Optional: Override display name
    communicationStyle: 'Custom style description' # Optional: Override style
    principles: # Optional: Add or replace principles
      - 'Custom principle for this project'
      - 'Another project-specific guideline'
```

### Override Behavior

**Precedence:** Customization > Manifest

**Merge Rules:**

- If field specified in customization, it replaces manifest value
- If field NOT specified, manifest value used
- Additional fields are added to agent personality
- Changes apply immediately when agent loaded

### Use Cases

**Adjust Formality:**

```yaml
agent:
  persona:
    communicationStyle: 'Formal and corporate-focused. Uses business terminology. Structured responses with executive summaries.'
```

**Add Domain Expertise:**

```yaml
agent:
  persona:
    identity: |
      Expert Product Manager with 15 years experience in healthcare SaaS.
      Deep understanding of HIPAA compliance, EHR integrations, and clinical workflows.
      Specializes in balancing regulatory requirements with user experience.
```

**Modify Principles:**

```yaml
agent:
  persona:
    principles:
      - 'HIPAA compliance is non-negotiable'
      - 'Prioritize patient safety over feature velocity'
      - 'Every feature must have clinical validation'
```

**Change Personality:**

```yaml
agent:
  persona:
    displayName: 'Alex' # Change from default "Amelia"
    communicationStyle: 'Casual and friendly. Uses emojis. Explains technical concepts in simple terms.'
```

### Party Mode Integration

Customizations automatically apply in party mode:

1. Party mode reads manifest
2. Checks for customization files
3. Merges customizations with manifest
4. Agents respond with customized personalities

**Example:**

```
You customize PM with healthcare expertise.
In party mode, PM now brings healthcare knowledge to discussions.
Other agents collaborate with PM's specialized perspective.
```

### Applying Customizations

**IMPORTANT:** Customizations don't take effect until you rebuild the agents.

**Complete Process:**

**Step 1: Create/Modify Customization File**

```bash
# Create customization file at:
# {project-root}/.bmad/_cfg/agents/{module}-{agent-name}.customize.yaml

# Example: .bmad/_cfg/agents/bmm-pm.customize.yaml
```

**Step 2: Regenerate Agent Manifest**

After modifying customization files, you must regenerate the agent manifest and rebuild agents:

```bash
# Run the installer to apply customizations
npx bmad-method install

# The installer will:
# 1. Read all customization files
# 2. Regenerate agent-manifest.csv with merged data
# 3. Rebuild agent .md files with customizations applied
```

**Step 3: Verify Changes**

Load the customized agent and verify the changes are reflected in its behavior and responses.

**Why This is Required:**

- Customization files are just configuration - they don't change agents directly
- The agent manifest must be regenerated to merge customizations
- Agent .md files must be rebuilt with the merged data
- Party mode and all workflows load agents from the rebuilt files

### Best Practices

1. **Keep it project-specific:** Customize for your domain, not general changes
2. **Don't break character:** Keep customizations aligned with agent's core role
3. **Test in party mode:** See how customizations interact with other agents
4. **Document why:** Add comments explaining customization purpose
5. **Share with team:** Customizations survive updates, can be version controlled
6. **Rebuild after changes:** Always run installer after modifying customization files

---

## Best Practices

### Agent Selection

**1. Start with workflow-status**

- When unsure where you are, load any agent and run `*workflow-status`
- Agent will analyze current project state and recommend next steps
- Works across all phases and all agents

**2. Match phase to agent**

- **Phase 1 (Analysis):** Analyst, Game Designer
- **Phase 2 (Planning):** PM, UX Designer, Game Designer
- **Phase 3 (Solutioning):** Architect, Game Architect
- **Phase 4 (Implementation):** SM, DEV, Game Developer
- **Testing:** TEA (all phases)
- **Documentation:** Technical Writer (all phases)

**3. Use specialists**

- **Testing:** TEA for comprehensive quality strategy

- Their recommendations are data-informed
- Their warnings prevent costly mistakes

**2. Answer their questions**

- Agents ask for important reasons
- Incomplete answers lead to assumptions
- Detailed responses yield better outcomes
- "I don't know" is a valid answer

**3. Follow workflows**

- Structured processes prevent missed steps
- Workflows encode best practices
- Sequential workflows build on each other
- Validation workflows catch errors early

**4. Customize when needed**

- Adjust agent personalities for your project
- Add domain-specific expertise
- Modify communication style for team preferences
- Keep customizations project-specific

### Common Workflows Patterns

**Starting a New Project (Greenfield):**

```
1. PM or Analyst: *workflow-init
2. Analyst: *brainstorm-project or *product-brief (optional)
3. PM: *create-prd (Level 2-4) or *tech-spec (Level 0-1)
4. Architect: *create-architecture (Level 3-4 only)
5. PM: *create-epics-and-stories (after architecture)
6. SM: *sprint-planning
```

**Starting with Existing Code (Brownfield):**

```
1. Analyst or Technical Writer: *document-project
2. PM or Analyst: *workflow-init
3. PM: *create-prd or *tech-spec
4. Architect: *create-architecture (if needed)
5. PM: *create-epics-and-stories (after architecture)
6. SM: *sprint-planning
```

**Story Development Cycle:**

```
1. SM: *epic-tech-context (optional, once per epic)
2. SM: *create-story
3. SM: *story-context
4. DEV: *develop-story
5. DEV: *code-review
6. DEV: *story-done
7. Repeat steps 2-6 for next story
```

**Testing Strategy:**

```
1. TEA: *framework (once per project, early)
2. TEA: *atdd (before implementing features)
3. DEV: *develop-story (includes tests)
4. TEA: *automate (comprehensive test suite)
5. TEA: *trace (quality gate)
6. TEA: *ci (pipeline setup)
```

**Game Development:**

```
1. Game Designer: *brainstorm-game
2. Game Designer: *create-gdd
3. Game Architect: *create-architecture
4. SM: *sprint-planning
5. Game Developer: *create-story
6. Game Developer: *dev-story
7. Game Developer: *code-review
```

### Navigation Tips

**Lost? Run workflow-status**

```
Load any agent → *workflow-status
Agent analyzes project state → recommends next workflow
```

**Phase transitions:**

```
Each phase has validation gates:
- Phase 2→3: validate-prd, validate-tech-spec
- Phase 3→4: implementation-readiness
Run validation before advancing
```

**Course correction:**

```
If priorities change mid-project:
Load PM, Architect, or SM → *correct-course
```

**Testing integration:**

```
TEA can be invoked at any phase:
- Phase 1: Test strategy planning
- Phase 2: Test scenarios in PRD
- Phase 3: Architecture testability review
- Phase 4: Test automation and CI
```
