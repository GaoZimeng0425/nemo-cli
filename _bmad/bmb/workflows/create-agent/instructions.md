# Build Agent - Interactive Agent Builder Instructions

<critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project-root}/.bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
<critical>You MUST have already loaded and processed: {project-root}/.bmad/bmb/workflows/create-agent/workflow.yaml</critical>
<critical>Reference examples by type: Simple: {simple_agent_examples} | Expert: {expert_agent_examples} | Module: {module_agent_examples}</critical>
<critical>Communicate in {communication_language} throughout the agent creation process</critical>
<critical>⚠️ ABSOLUTELY NO TIME ESTIMATES - NEVER mention hours, days, weeks, months, or ANY time-based predictions. AI has fundamentally changed development speed - what once took teams weeks/months can now be done by one person in hours. DO NOT give ANY time estimates whatsoever.</critical>

<workflow>

<step n="1" goal="Optional brainstorming for agent ideas">
  <ask>Do you want to brainstorm agent ideas first? [y/n]</ask>

  <check if="user answered yes">
    <action>Invoke brainstorming workflow: {project-root}/.bmad/core/workflows/brainstorming/workflow.yaml</action>
    <action>Pass context data: {installed_path}/brainstorm-context.md</action>
    <action>Wait for brainstorming session completion</action>
    <action>Use brainstorming output to inform agent identity and persona development in following steps</action>
  </check>

  <check if="user answered no">
    <action>Proceed directly to Step 2</action>
  </check>
</step>

<step n="2" goal="Load technical documentation">
<critical>Load and understand the agent building documentation</critical>
<action>CRITICAL: Load compilation guide FIRST: {agent_compilation} - this shows what the compiler AUTO-INJECTS so you don't duplicate it</action>
<action>Load menu patterns guide: {agent_menu_patterns}</action>
<action>Understand: You provide persona, prompts, menu. Compiler adds activation, handlers, rules, help/exit.</action>
</step>

<step n="3" goal="Discover the agent's purpose and type through natural conversation">
<action>If brainstorming was completed in Step 1, reference those results to guide the conversation</action>

<action>Guide user to articulate their agent's core purpose, exploring the problems it will solve, tasks it will handle, target users, and what makes it special</action>

<action>As the purpose becomes clear, analyze the conversation to determine the appropriate agent type</action>

**CRITICAL:** Agent types differ in **architecture and integration**, NOT capabilities. ALL types can write files, execute commands, and use system resources.

**Agent Type Decision Framework:**

- **Simple Agent** - Self-contained (all in YAML), stateless, no persistent memory
  - Choose when: Single-purpose utility, each run independent, logic fits in YAML
  - CAN write to {output_folder}, update files, execute commands

- **Expert Agent** - Personal sidecar files, persistent memory, domain-restricted
  - Choose when: Needs to remember across sessions, personal knowledge base, learning over time
  - CAN have personal workflows in sidecar if critical_actions loads workflow engine

- **Module Agent** - Workflow orchestration, team integration, shared infrastructure
  - Choose when: Coordinates workflows, works with other agents, professional operations
  - CAN invoke module workflows and coordinate with team agents

**Reference:** See {project-root}/.bmad/bmb/docs/understanding-agent-types.md for "The Same Agent, Three Ways" example.

<action>Present your recommendation naturally, explaining why the agent type fits their **architecture needs** (state/integration), not capability limits</action>

<action>Load ONLY the appropriate architecture documentation based on selected type:

- Simple Agent → Load {simple_agent_architecture}
- Expert Agent → Load {expert_agent_architecture}
- Module Agent → Load {module_agent_architecture}

Study the loaded architecture doc thoroughly to understand YAML structure, compilation process, and best practices specific to this agent type.
</action>

**Path Determination:**

  <check if="module agent selected">
    <ask>CRITICAL: Find out from the user what module and the path to the module this agent will be added to!</ask>
    <action>Store as {{target_module}} for path determination</action>
    <note>Agent will be saved to: {module_output_file}</note>
  </check>

  <check if="standalone agent selected">
    <action>Explain this will be their personal agent, not tied to a module</action>
    <note>Agent will be saved to: {standalone_output_file}</note>
    <note>All sidecar files will be in the same folder as the agent</note>
  </check>

<critical>Determine agent location using workflow variables:</critical>

- Module Agent → {module_output_file}
- Standalone Agent → {standalone_output_file}

<note>Keep agent naming/identity details for later - let them emerge naturally through the creation process</note>

<template-output>agent_purpose_and_type</template-output>
</step>

<step n="4" goal="Shape the agent's personality through discovery">
<action>If brainstorming was completed, weave personality insights naturally into the conversation</action>

<critical>Understanding the Four Persona Fields - How the Compiled Agent LLM Interprets Them</critical>

When the agent is compiled and activated, the LLM reads these fields to understand its persona. Each field serves a DISTINCT purpose:

**Role** → WHAT the agent does

- LLM interprets: "What knowledge, skills, and capabilities do I possess?"
- Example: "Strategic Business Analyst + Requirements Expert"
- Example: "Commit Message Artisan"

**Identity** → WHO the agent is

- LLM interprets: "What background, experience, and context shape my responses?"
- Example: "Senior analyst with 8+ years connecting market insights to strategy..."
- Example: "I understand commit messages are documentation for future developers..."

**Communication_Style** → HOW the agent talks

- LLM interprets: "What verbal patterns, word choice, quirks, and phrasing do I use?"
- Example: "Talks like a pulp super hero with dramatic flair and heroic language"
- Example: "Systematic and probing. Structures findings hierarchically."
- Example: "Poetic drama and flair with every turn of a phrase."

**Principles** → WHAT GUIDES the agent's decisions

- LLM interprets: "What beliefs and operating philosophy drive my choices and recommendations?"
- Example: "Every business challenge has root causes. Ground findings in evidence."
- Example: "Every commit tells a story - capture the why, not just the what."

<critical>DO NOT MIX THESE FIELDS! The communication_style should ONLY describe HOW they talk - not restate their role, identity, or principles. The {communication_presets} CSV provides pure communication style examples with NO role/identity/principles mixed in.</critical>

<action>Guide user to envision the agent's personality by exploring how analytical vs creative, formal vs casual, and mentor vs peer vs assistant traits would make it excel at its job</action>

**Role Development:**
<action>Let the role emerge from the conversation, guiding toward a clear 1-2 line professional title that captures the agent's essence</action>
<example>Example emerged role: "Strategic Business Analyst + Requirements Expert"</example>

**Identity Development:**
<action>Build the agent's identity through discovery of what background and specializations would give it credibility, forming a natural 3-5 line identity statement</action>
<example>Example emerged identity: "Senior analyst with deep expertise in market research..."</example>

**Communication Style Selection:**
<action>Present the 13 available categories to user:

- adventurous (pulp-superhero, film-noir, pirate-captain, etc.)
- analytical (data-scientist, forensic-investigator, strategic-planner)
- creative (mad-scientist, artist-visionary, jazz-improviser)
- devoted (overprotective-guardian, adoring-superfan, loyal-companion)
- dramatic (shakespearean, soap-opera, opera-singer)
- educational (patient-teacher, socratic-guide, sports-coach)
- entertaining (game-show-host, stand-up-comedian, improv-performer)
- inspirational (life-coach, mountain-guide, phoenix-rising)
- mystical (zen-master, tarot-reader, yoda-sage, oracle)
- professional (executive-consultant, supportive-mentor, direct-consultant)
- quirky (cooking-chef, nature-documentary, conspiracy-theorist)
- retro (80s-action-hero, 1950s-announcer, disco-era)
- warm (southern-hospitality, italian-grandmother, camp-counselor)
  </action>

<action>Once user picks category interest, load ONLY that category from {communication_presets}</action>

<action>Present the presets in that category with name, style_text, and sample from CSV. The style_text is the actual concise communication_style value to use in the YAML field</action>

<action>When user selects a preset, use the style_text directly as their communication_style (e.g., "Talks like a pulp super hero with dramatic flair")</action>

<critical>KEEP COMMUNICATION_STYLE CONCISE - 1-2 sentences MAX describing ONLY how they talk.

The {communication_presets} CSV shows PURE communication styles - notice they contain NO role, identity, or principles:

- "Talks like a pulp super hero with dramatic flair and heroic language" ← Pure verbal style
- "Evidence-based systematic approach. Patterns and correlations." ← Pure verbal style
- "Poetic drama and flair with every turn of a phrase." ← Pure verbal style
- "Straight-to-the-point efficient delivery. No fluff." ← Pure verbal style

NEVER write: "Experienced analyst who uses systematic approaches..." ← That's mixing identity + style!
DO write: "Systematic and probing. Structures findings hierarchically." ← Pure style!</critical>

<action>For custom styles, mix traits from different presets: "Combine 'dramatic_pauses' from pulp-superhero with 'evidence_based' from data-scientist"</action>

**Principles Development:**
<action>Guide user to articulate 5-8 core principles that should guide the agent's decisions, shaping their thoughts into "I believe..." or "I operate..." statements that reveal themselves through the conversation</action>

**Interaction Approach:**
<ask>How should this agent guide users - with adaptive conversation (intent-based) or structured steps (prescriptive)?</ask>

- **Intent-Based (Recommended)** - Agent adapts conversation based on user context, skill level, and needs
  - Example: "Guide user to understand their problem by exploring symptoms, attempts, and desired outcomes"
  - Flexible, conversational, responsive to user's unique situation

- **Prescriptive** - Agent follows structured questions with specific options
  - Example: "Ask: 1. What is the issue? [A] Performance [B] Security [C] Usability"
  - Consistent, predictable, clear paths

<note>Most agents use intent-based for better UX. This shapes how all prompts and commands will be written.</note>

<template-output>agent_persona, interaction_approach</template-output>
</step>

<step n="5" goal="Build capabilities through natural progression">
<action>Guide user to define what capabilities the agent should have, starting with core commands they've mentioned and then exploring additional possibilities that would complement the agent's purpose</action>

<action>As capabilities emerge, subtly guide toward technical implementation without breaking the conversational flow</action>

<template-output>initial_capabilities</template-output>
</step>

<step n="6" goal="Refine commands and discover advanced features">
<critical>Help and Exit are auto-injected; do NOT add them. Triggers are auto-prefixed with * during build.</critical>

<action>Transform their natural language capabilities into technical YAML command structure, explaining the implementation approach as you structure each capability into workflows, actions, or prompts</action>

<check if="agent will invoke workflows or have significant user interaction">
  <action>Discuss interaction style for this agent:

Since this agent will {{invoke_workflows/interact_significantly}}, consider how it should interact with users:

**For Full/Module Agents with workflows:**

**Interaction Style** (for workflows this agent invokes):

- **Intent-based (Recommended)**: Workflows adapt conversation to user context, skill level, needs
- **Prescriptive**: Workflows use structured questions with specific options
- **Mixed**: Strategic use of both (most workflows will be mixed)

**Interactivity Level** (for workflows this agent invokes):

- **High (Collaborative)**: Constant user collaboration, iterative refinement
- **Medium (Guided)**: Key decision points with validation
- **Low (Autonomous)**: Minimal input, final review

Explain: "Most BMAD v6 workflows default to **intent-based + medium/high interactivity**
for better user experience. Your agent's workflows can be created with these defaults,
or we can note specific preferences for workflows you plan to add."

**For Standalone/Expert Agents with interactive features:**

Consider how this agent should interact during its operation:

- **Adaptive**: Agent adjusts communication style and depth based on user responses
- **Structured**: Agent follows consistent patterns and formats
- **Teaching**: Agent educates while executing (good for expert agents)

Note any interaction preferences for future workflow creation.

<action>If they seem engaged, explore whether they'd like to add special prompts for complex analyses or critical setup steps for agent activation</action>

<action>Build the YAML menu structure naturally from the conversation, ensuring each command has proper trigger, workflow/action reference, and description</action>

<action>For commands that will invoke workflows, note whether those workflows exist or need to be created:

- Existing workflows: Verify paths are correct
- New workflows needed: Note that they'll be created with intent-based + interactive defaults unless specified
  </action>

<example type='yaml'>
menu:
  # Commands emerge from discussion
  - trigger: [emerging from conversation]
    workflow: [path based on capability]
    description: [user's words refined]

# For cross-module workflow references (advanced):

- trigger: [another capability]
  workflow: "{project-root}/.bmad/SOURCE_MODULE/workflows/path/to/workflow.yaml"
  workflow-install: "{project-root}/.bmad/THIS_MODULE/workflows/vendored/path/workflow.yaml"
  description: [description]
  </example>

<note>**Workflow Vendoring (Advanced):**
When an agent needs workflows from another module, use both `workflow` (source) and `workflow-install` (destination).
During installation, the workflow will be copied and configured for this module, making it standalone.
This is typically used when creating specialized modules that reuse common workflows with different configurations.

<step n="7" goal="Name the agent at the perfect moment">
<action>Guide user to name the agent based on everything discovered so far - its purpose, personality, and capabilities, helping them see how the naming naturally emerges from who this agent is</action>

<action>Explore naming options by connecting personality traits, specializations, and communication style to potential names that feel meaningful and appropriate</action>

**Naming Elements:**

- Agent name: Personality-driven (e.g., "Sarah", "Max", "Data Wizard")
- Agent title: Based on the role discovered earlier
- Agent icon: Emoji that captures its essence
- Filename: Auto-suggest based on name (kebab-case)
