### [Writing Workflows](./writing-workflows.md)

Complete guide to creating workflows: workflow.md control files, step files, CSV data integration, and frontmatter design.

### [Step Files & Dialog Patterns](./step-files.md)

Crafting effective step files: structure, execution rules, prescriptive vs intent-based dialog, and validation patterns.

### [Templates & Content Generation](./templates.md)

Creating append-only templates, frontmatter design, conditional content, and dynamic content generation strategies.

### [Workflow Patterns](./patterns.md)

Common workflow types: linear, conditional, protocol integration, multi-agent workflows, and real-world examples.

### [Migration Guide](./migration.md)

Converting from XML-heavy workflows to the new pure markdown format, with before/after examples and checklist.

### [Best Practices & Reference](./best-practices.md)

Critical rules, anti-patterns, performance optimization, debugging, quick reference templates, and troubleshooting.

## 🚀 Quick Start

BMAD workflows are pure markdown, self-contained systems that guide collaborative processes through structured step files where the AI acts as a facilitator working with humans.
