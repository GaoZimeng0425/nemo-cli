# Epic and Story Decomposition Workflow
name: create-epics-and-stories
description: "Transform PRD requirements into bite-sized stories organized into deliverable functional epics. This workflow takes a Product Requirements Document (PRD) and breaks it down into epics and user stories that can be easily assigned to development teams. It ensures that all functional requirements are captured in a structured format, making it easier for teams to understand and implement the necessary features."
